- Hooks are a series of experiences that can together modify user behavior and encourage formation of new habits.

- As we will see, greater accessibility, more data and improved speed of delivery have increased the likelihood of hooks being employed to drive habit formation in our times.

- The hooks employed by companies essentially follow a four-phase process called the Hook Model. Successful products go through multiple cycles of these four phases to reach a refined stage where users keep coming back for more on their own, without any need for aggressive marketing by the company.

Trigger – External or internal cues that prompt certain behavior
Action – Use of the product, based on ease of use and motivation
Variable Reward – The reason for product use, which keeps the user engaged
Investment – A useful input from the user that commits him to go through the cycle again

Chapter 1: The Habit Zone
    Benefits of habit-forming
        Getting consumers to form habits related to their products can be critical for many companies to succeed, but it is not necessary for every single company.
        For cases where it is needed, and where a company successfully manages to achieve it, habit forming can have a number of benefits. These include:
        increased customer lifetime value (CLTV) – the amount of money that the company can make from customers before they move to competing offerings
        more flexibility in raising prices or charging for premium services
        supercharged growth by word-of-mouth publicity (characterized by Viral Cycle Time – the amount of time taken by a user to invite another user)
        greater competitive edge, because the competition finds it difficult to make inroads, e.g. people continue to use the QWERTY keyboard despite better keyboards available
        But people are creatures of habits, and creating new ones requires them to forget certain old ones.
        This means that for new types of behavior to really become ingrained into our decision-making systems, they need to be reinforced again and again.
        The benefit is that once you have succeeded in turning your product into a habit, another competing product will find it tougher to displace your product, e.g. Google’s ubiquity and synonymity with Internet search has meant that products that are not particularly bad, like Bing, have failed to become as popular.


How to test the habit-forming potential of your product?
    Use the frequency-vs.-perceived utility plot. If the product falls in the Habit Zone, i.e. is used often and has a high 
    enough utility compared to competing solutions, then using it can become default behavior for a consumer.
    
    In one of the two examples marked in the figure, a single search result on any engine other than Google is not noticeably 
    poorer than what you would get on Google, but Google is used so frequently that it is the option most of us turn to.
    
    On the other hand, purchasing on Amazon is nowhere as frequent as much of our other online activity, but its perceived 
    utility is higher because we know that every time we log on to Amazon, the likelihood of finding the product we are 
    looking for is high and it is also going to be available at a competitive price.

    Frequency and percieved utility

The position of a product on this chart is not static - many habit-forming products start off as vitamins, but with repeated use, turn into painkillers that satisfy the itch to use them.
Vitamins are products that do not solve an obvious problem, but feel nice to have, while painkillers are products that cater to a very obvious need.
Many products that are habits for us now because of their perceived utility to us might have been less important to begin with.
Before we delve further into the Hook Model, an important caveat: In the quest to encourage consumers to form habits, product designers and sellers should not forget that this is a type of manipulation. Conscientious sellers always need to ensure that the habits, or addictions, they encourage are healthy. We will consider this very important aspect a few chapters later.


Chapter 2: Trigger (Phase 1)
    Habits, much like pearls, need a foundation and layer upon layer (of continued behavior change) to be completely formed. Triggers are the cue or the foundation for this behavior change.
    Triggers can be of two types: external and internal.

External triggers
    These are bits of information from users’ surroundings that prompt them to perform an action. Types include:
    Paid triggers – channels like advertising that capture attention, but are too expensive for the long run
    Earned triggers – continued media presence, like viral video and press mentions, which can be difficult to sustain for any product
    Relationship triggers – come from engaged users who enthusiastically share information with other potential users
    Owned triggers – most useful, as these employ tacit permission from users to send triggers like app updates and periodic notifications into their personal space.

Internal triggers
    For a product to truly become a habit, its triggers need to move from the external forms to the internal.
    Internal triggers are driven by users’ emotions and associations stored in their memory.
    Trying to rid oneself of negative emotions like boredom and loneliness are powerful triggers for using a particular product.
    As a product relieves these negative emotions repeatedly, our mind subconsciously begins to associate it with this relief.
    This gradually strengthens the bond with a product, resulting in the formation of a habit, e.g. our reliance on Facebook or Twitter for instant social connection.
    Designing a habit-forming product requires an understanding of the emotions that are tied to these internal triggers, 
    as well as knowledge of how external triggers can be used effectively to urge a user to perform a certain action.


Chapter 3: Action (Phase 2)
    The Behavior Model developed by Dr. B.J. Fogg of Stanford University says that the user’s behavior (or action) depends on three prerequisites (B = MAT):
        M – sufficient motivation
        A – ability to perform a certain action
        T – a trigger to prompt the action
        Therefore, for a clear trigger to be effective, the user should be motivated enough and should be able to perform the action with minimal effect.
