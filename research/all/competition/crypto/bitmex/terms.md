7.6: You acknowledge, agree and understand that if you travel to any Restricted Jurisdiction, our Services may not be available and your access to our Services may be blocked. You acknowledge that this may impact your ability to trade on the Trading Platform or monitor any existing orders or open positions or otherwise use the Services.

7.7: You acknowledge and agree that there are a series of inherent risks with the use of mobile trading technology such as the BitMEX Mobile Application including, but not limited to, latency in the prices provided.

Your failure to do so might lead to certain parts of the Services (including trading functions) becoming temporarily inaccessible to you until such update has been downloaded and installed.

7.8: You acknowledge, agree and understand that certain of the Services (including any software that may be produced, developed or published by the HDR Group from time to time) may be beta versions being tested at the time of release (a “Development Service”).

The HDR Group does not warrant that the functionality of Development Services will meet your requirements or that the operation of Development Services will be uninterrupted or error-free. HDR reserves the right, at any time and for any reason, to discontinue, redesign, modify, enhance or change any Services (including the Development Services).

7.9: You acknowledge, agree and understand that:

a) BitMEX Testnet is provided for informational and testing purposes, and not for educational purposes;

b) whilst BitMEX Testnet uses the same market data and indices as the Trading Platform, there may be discrepancies between the BitMEX Testnet and the Trading Platform; and

b) the HDR Group’s and the Associated Parties’ aggregate liability in contract, tort or otherwise (including any liability for any negligent act or omission) howsoever arising out of or in connection with the performance of its obligations under these Terms in respect of any one or more incidents or occurrences shall be limited to the total net amount of Bitcoin received by HDR from you by way of trading fees in connection with your use of the Trading Platform in the six-month period immediately prior to the date of the incident, or the first incident of a series of connected incidents, giving rise to a claim made by you under these Terms.
