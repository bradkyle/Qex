1. Description of the Affiliate Program
To enroll and participate in the Affiliate Program, you must be a natural person (and not any corporate or entity, partnerships of any type or form, trust or any entity, program or protocol that is partly or wholly based on or executing artificial intelligence or machine learning programs or protocols) and have an active BitMEX account, subject to and in compliance with the requirements of any agreements you have with BitMEX, such as BitMEX’s Terms of Service and this Services Agreement.

The BitMEX Affiliate Program allows you to provide a platform for advertising BitMEX via your “web site” or “publishing location” (such as an electronic newsletter or blog), thereby driving traffic to BitMEX web site or web site content, whereby you may earn a portion of the revenue generated (“Commission”) if a person that is not you or your Related Persons as defined below (“Visitor”) trades a BitMEX-listed product after being referred to the BitMEX web site from an internet hyperlink (“Link”) contained on your web site or publishing location.

After being referred to the BitMEX web site from a Link contained on your web site or publishing location, Visitors have seven (7) days to complete their registration in order for your accounts to be linked. Should the Visitor click on another web site or publishing location’s Link that is not controlled by you or Related Persons, or return to the BitMEX web site via another source-coded advertising Link during the initial seven (7) days, your Link will be overwritten and you will not receive a Commission for that Visitor’s account.

You are not eligible for a Commission on trades made by you or any Related Persons, your employees, agents, representatives, or contractors, as well as made from several accounts owned by the same person; and BitMEX employees (or their Related Persons) are not allowed to participate in the BitMEX Affiliate Program.

You are also not eligible for any Commission derived from any persons referred to BitMEX’s platform relying on any materials, videos, content, deliverables, work product owned by or licensed to BitMEX (such as its research, blog or social media materials) linked, published, used, exploited or posted on your web site or publishing location.

For purposes of this Agreement, “Family” of an individual includes (i) the individual, (ii) the individual’s spouse and former spouse (whether legally designated as spouse or otherwise), (iii) any other natural person who is related to the individual or the individual’s spouse within the second degree, and (iv) any other natural person who resides with such individual.

This limitation applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, warranty, negligence, strict liability or any other basis, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages or such damages were reasonably foreseeable. Because certain jurisdictions do not permit the limitation or elimination of liability for consequential or incidental damages, our liability in such jurisdictions shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

Such written assurances may include, in our sole discretion, the posting of a performance bond(s) or other guarantees reasonably calculated to guarantee payment.

11. Waiver

12. Enforceability
In the event that any provision of this Services Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Services Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole.
