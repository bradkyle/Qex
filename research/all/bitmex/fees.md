Other Fees
Funding
On our Perpetual Contracts, such as XBTUSD, funding is exchanged between longs and shorts over discrete Funding Intervals. In your Trade History a positive amount means you paid funding for that Funding Interval; a negative amount means you received funding. BitMEX does not charge any fees on funding paid or received.

Please refer to the Perpetual Contracts Guide for more information on Funding.

Deposits / Withdrawals
BitMEX does not charge fees on deposits or withdrawals. When withdrawing Bitcoin, the minimum Bitcoin Network fee is set dynamically based on blockchain load.

Order Type Exceptions
Hidden / Iceberg Orders
A Hidden order always pays the taker fee. An Iceberg order pays the taker fee until the hidden quantity is completely executed, then it becomes a normal order and they will receive the maker fee for the non-hidden quantity.
